# TrafficLight

TrafficLight was one of my earliest app creations, and it the final assessment for my RMIT - Development with Swift Foundations course. The task was to design an app that clarifies traffic light sequences even to those unfamiliar with them. The project required I produce error-free code in iOS Swift language that could be compiled and run in Xcode.
The app needed to create views and change state to transition between them. I had a choice between two methods: using a single button to cycle through the light sequence or three buttons and ensure the user could only press each in the correct sequence. I opted for the latter approach, as it posed a more intricate challenge.
